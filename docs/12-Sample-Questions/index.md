Question 1:

You are developing a machine learning model to predict customer churn. Which type of machine learning is most appropriate for this scenario?

A. Unsupervised learning
B. Reinforcement learning
C. Supervised learning
D. Deep learning

✅ Correct Answer: C. Supervised learning

Let’s go through each option:

A. Unsupervised learning ❌
Why it's incorrect: Unsupervised learning is used when you don’t have labeled data. It’s great for clustering or dimensionality reduction, like grouping customers by behavior without knowing in advance what those groups are.
Use case: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, topic modeling.

B. Reinforcement learning ❌
Why it's incorrect: Reinforcement learning is used when an agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties. It’s not suitable for static datasets like customer churn.
Use case: Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo), robotics, dynamic pricing.

C. Supervised learning ✅
Why it's correct: You have labeled data (customers who did or didn’t churn), and you want to train a model to predict that label for new customers.
Use case: Fraud detection, email spam filtering, loan default prediction.

D. Deep learning ❌
Why it's incorrect: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, often used for complex tasks like image or speech recognition. While you could use deep learning for churn prediction, it’s not the type of learning—it’s a technique within supervised learning.
Use case: Image classification, natural language processing, voice assistants.
