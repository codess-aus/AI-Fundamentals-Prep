# 🔍 Info Extraction IRL: Gen Alpha Style

Today’s orgs are vibing with all kinds of content — think docs, vids, audio, pics, and text. One of the big brain moves they make? Pulling out the good stuff and saving it in databases. 💾

## 🚀 Real-World Scenarios

- 🏭 **Factory Feels**  
  A manufacturer’s got pics of every product. They need to scan those for glitches and weird stuff. 👀
- 💼 **Biz Buzz**  
  A company’s drowning in invoices, contracts, and reports with charts. They gotta grab the key data and TL;DR it into logs. 📊

- ☎️ **Call Chaos**  
  Tons of customer calls are recorded for quality checks. The audio needs to be turned into text, summed up, and mood-checked. 🎧➡️📝😐😃

- 📺 **Stream Scene**  
  A streaming service has loads of vids. They need to tag the epic moments with smart labels. 🎬✨

## 🧠 Why AI Is the MVP

Doing all this manually? 🐌 Slow and kinda sus. AI-powered info extraction is the cheat code — it pulls meaning from content like a pro. 🧠💡

# 🧠 AI Info Extraction: Gen Alpha Edition

AI is like your digital detective 🕵️‍♀️ — it helps orgs unlock 🔓 hidden gems 💎 from stuff like docs, pics, audio, and more. Whether it’s neat and tidy (structured) or messy and wild (unstructured), AI’s got it covered.

## 📦 What’s the Content Vibe?

- **Structured Content** = info in a clean format  
  🧾 Examples: invoices, tax forms, tables

- **Unstructured Content** = info in chaos mode  
  📧🎧📸📹 Examples: emails, audio recordings, images, videos

## 🛠️ How Info Extraction Goes Down

| Step | What’s Happening |
|------|------------------|
| 🔍 Source ID | Find where the info lives. Is it digital or nah? |
| 🧠 Extraction | Use ML magic to read and grab the data |
| 🔄 Transform & Structure | Turn it into JSON, tables, or other neat formats |
| 🗃️ Store & Plug In | Save it in databases, data lakes, or analytics hubs |

## 🎯 What You Wanna Know = What You Gotta Use

The kind of content + the kind of insights = the tools you need. In this module, we’re diving into how AI extracts info from:

- 🖼️ Images  
- 🧾 Forms  
- 🔀 Multiple Modalities  
- 🧠 Knowledge Mining  

These techniques? They stack like LEGOs — each one builds on the last. 🧱➡️🏗️

Let’s get into it! 🚀

# 🤖 AI Vision Power-Up: Gen Alpha Style

Manual content-checking? Nah, we’ve got AI for that. 🧠✨  
AI info extraction = no more eyeballing every doc, pic, or audio file for insights. It’s all about speed, smarts, and automation.

## 👀 What’s the Deal with Computer Vision?

Computer vision = AI’s way of seeing stuff.  
It uses machine learning models trained on tons of images to spot people, places, things, and words. 📸➡️🔢➡️🧠

Basically, it turns pics into numbers, does some math magic, and boom — it knows what’s in the image. 🧮🔍

## ✍️ OCR = AI’s Text Decoder

Imagine a screenshot of an envelope with a handwritten address.  
OCR (Optical Character Recognition) reads that handwriting and turns it into digital text. 🖋️➡️💻

OCR helps AI spot text in images — letters, numbers, punctuation — all the good stuff.  
It started with postal services auto-sorting mail by zip codes. 📬  
Now? It’s next-level. AI can read printed or handwritten text line-by-line and word-by-word. 🧠📝

## 🧾 Next Up: Form Data Extraction

Let’s level up.  
We’re gonna see how AI uses OCR and other cool tricks to pull data from forms.  
It’s like OCR 2.0 — smarter, faster, and ready to handle all kinds of formats. 🚀

# 🧾 Form Data Extraction: Gen Alpha Style

## 💬 What’s the Meaning Behind the Text?

Forms and docs aren’t just words — they’ve got **semantic meaning**.  
That means the words actually *mean* something in context, not just dictionary defs. 🧠💡

---

## 📚 Enter: Document Intelligence

This is AI that reads text and *gets* what it means.  
It’s like OCR’s cooler, smarter cousin. 🤖🕶️  
It automates the whole “read and understand” thing.

---

## 🧾 Real Talk: Receipts & Forms

Imagine a company drowning in receipts for expenses, projects, and accounting.  
With document intelligence, they scan a receipt, OCR it, and boom — AI pulls out the meaning. 💥

### 🧠 Semantic Meaning = Field-Value Pairs

- **Field Name** = what kind of data it is  
- **Field Description** = what that field means  
- **Value** = the actual data

📄 Example: In an invoice, AI might grab:

- Merchant’s name, address, phone  
- Purchase date & time  
- Items bought + quantity + price  
- Totals, subtotals, tax

![Receipt](https://github.com/codess-aus/AI-Fundamentals-Prep/blob/7760483d5b3a2cc3b08fac6bc3b1a6a4bcf8b55c/docs/assets/contoso-receipt.png)

## 📦 Bounding Boxes FTW

AI sees data in forms using **bounding boxes** — like coordinates around the info.  
🖼️ Example:  
Address = `123 Main Street`  
Coordinates = `[4.1, 2.2], [4.3, 2.2], [4.3, 2.4], [4.1, 2.4]`

ML models are trained to spot patterns in those boxes. 🔍📐

---

## 🎯 Confidence Levels

Every field-value pair comes with a **confidence score** (0 to 1).  
Closer to 1 = AI’s pretty sure it nailed it. ✅  
Lower score = maybe double-check. 🤔

Ready to level up? Next, we’ll see how OCR powers even cooler stuff like form extraction. 🚀

# 🧠 Multimodal Data Extraction: Gen Alpha Style

## 🔄 What’s Multimodal Extraction?

AI doesn’t just vibe with one type of content — it’s got range.  
It can pull data from docs, vids, audio, and more. 🎥📄🎧  
This is called **multimodal data extraction** — and it’s a game-changer for:

- 💼 Digital asset management  
- ⚙️ Workflow automation  
- 🔍 Generating insights  
- 📊 Boosting productivity

---

## 🧩 The Extraction Squad

Multimodal pipelines mix and match AI tools like:

### 👁️ Vision + Document Intelligence  
Reads images and docs, finds meaning, and makes sense of it all.

### 🗣️ Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
Finds key phrases, entities, vibes (aka sentiment) in written or spoken words.  
> 💡 *Want more?* Check out *Intro to NLP concepts*.

### 🎤 Speech Recognition  
Turns spoken words into text — whether it’s a voice memo or live mic input.  
> 💡 *Learn more in* *Get started with speech on Azure*.

### 🤖 Generative AI  
Lets you create your own fields like “summary” and fills them in based on the content.  
Super clutch for messy, unstructured stuff.

## 🛠️ How It All Comes Together

Multimodal pipelines layer these techniques to extract structured insights and even generate new content.  
Think of it like stacking tools to build a super-smart content bot. 🧱🤖

# 🧠 Knowledge Mining with AI

## 🔍 What’s Knowledge Mining?

Knowledge mining = AI digging through tons of messy data to find the good stuff.  
It’s like search on steroids — pulling smart insights from docs, vids, audio, and more. 📚🎧📸

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🧨 Step 1: Document Cracking  
AI cracks open files like PDFs and pulls out the text (ASCII style) for analysis. 📄💥

### ✨ Step 2: AI Enrichment  
AI adds extra sauce — like captions for pics or mood checks on text.  
This enriched content goes into a **knowledge store** for deeper analysis or future use. 🧠📦

### 🧾 Step 3: JSON Magic  
All that data gets turned into JSON and dropped into a **search index**.  
Now you can search it like a boss. 🔍💬

---

## 📊 Search Index Schema = AI’s Cheat Sheet

A search index is like a table with:

- **Fields** = the data spots  
- **Data Types** = like string, number, etc.  
- **Attributes** = for filtering, sorting, etc.

![json](https://github.com/codess-aus/AI-Fundamentals-Prep/blob/2c30fea011ed31b18ce47b92fd6af29293432fd9/docs/assets/json-index-example.png)

## 🧩 Search Solution Components

| 🔧 Component | 💡 What It Does |
|-------------|-----------------|
| API Layer | Takes your query and sends it to the search engine |
| Query Processor | Breaks down and understands your query |
| Search Strategies | Picks how to search (keyword, semantic, vector, hybrid) |
| Execution Engine | Runs the search across the index |
| Result Aggregator | Combines results from different sources |
| Ranking Engine | Sorts results by relevance, freshness, popularity, or AI vibes |
| Response Formatter | Makes the results look good for you |
