## 🧰 Microsoft’s AI Toolbox

Microsoft’s got a whole ecosystem of tools to help you build epic generative AI apps.  
Next up: Let’s explore the wild world of generative AI applications! 🌍🚀

# 🤖 Understanding Generative AI Apps

## 🧠 What Powers These Apps?

Generative AI apps run on **language models** — they’re the brains behind the scenes 🧠💬  
These models handle the logic and make the magic happen when you chat with AI.

![Application logic](https://github.com/codess-aus/AI-Fundamentals-Prep/blob/46c9ceb2b86ce33f09633fbd75c4f3f91712d2ac/docs/assets/application-logic-image.png)

## 💬 Meet the Assistants

Think: chatbots that actually *get* you.  
Like **Microsoft Copilot** — your AI-powered work buddy that helps write, plan, and get stuff DONE. 📝⚡

> 💡 Copilot lives inside Microsoft apps and boosts productivity with smart content + task automation.  
> Devs can even build plug-ins or create their own Copilot-style agents. 🔧🧑‍💻

---

## 🕹️ Meet the Agents

Agents = AI that *does stuff* for you.  
Like filing taxes, booking rides, or sending meeting maps. 🗺️🚕

Agents have 3 key parts:

1. 🧠 Language model (for thinking + understanding)
2. 📋 Instructions (goals + rules)
3. 🛠️ Tools (to actually do the tasks)

> 💡 Most AI apps today mix assistants + agents + other cool features.  
> Managing all these parts together = **orchestration** 🎶🤖

## 🧰 Types of Generative AI Apps

Let’s break it down into 3 buckets 🪣👇

### ✅ Ready-to-Use  
Just start typing! No coding needed.  
Perfect for quick tasks + casual users.

### 🔧 Extendable  
Use your own data to make it smarter.  
Example: Microsoft Copilot — ready-to-go *and* customizable.

### 🏗️ Build-Your-Own  
Start from scratch with a language model.  
Create your own assistant or agent with full control.
