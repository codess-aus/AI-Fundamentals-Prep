# 🔍 Build a Knowledge Mining Solution with Azure AI Search

## ☁️ What’s Azure AI Search?

It’s not just search — it’s **smart search**.  
Azure AI Search uses AI skills to pull insights from all kinds of data (docs, images, audio, etc.) and works with other AI tools like Azure AI Vision and Document Intelligence.  
Perfect for building epic digital asset management and knowledge mining setups. 💾🧠

---

## 🧩 Key Parts of the Setup

### 🔁 Indexers, Indexes & Skills

At the core is the **indexer** — it’s like the brain of the operation. It does:

1. **Ingest** data from places like Azure Storage or databases  
2. **Crack** docs open to grab text + images (like from PDFs)  
3. **Apply AI Skills** to extract info and build a field hierarchy

Some fields come straight from the source (like file names), others are AI-generated:

- 🖼️ Azure AI Vision → tags + captions for images  
- 🧠 Azure AI Language → sentiment + named entities  
- 📄 Azure AI Document Intelligence → field values from forms

![Indexer](/docs/assets/indexer.png)

## 🔍 Searchable Index = Smart Results

Once the index is built, users can search using keywords + filters.  
It’s like having a supercharged search bar that actually understands your content. 🔎⚡

---

## 🗃️ Save It All to a Knowledge Store

Besides building a search index, Azure AI Search can save the extracted goodies to a **knowledge store** in Azure Storage.

### 🧠 What It Can Store:

- Tables of field values  
- Images pulled from docs  
- JSON docs with complex data structures
