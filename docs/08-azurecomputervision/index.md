# 👀 What’s Computer Vision? Let’s Break It Down!

Computer vision is like giving super-eyes to machines! 🦾👁️  
It’s a part of AI (artificial intelligence) that helps tech understand what it sees—photos, videos, even live camera feeds. Cool, right?

It’s not just smart—it’s a time-saver and a game-changer. Let’s check out how it’s used in the real world:

---

## 🏭 Manufacturing – Spot the Oops!

Machines scan products zoom-zoom on the assembly line.  
They catch scratches, missing parts, or things out of place using smart image tools.  
Less waste, better quality. Boom! 💥

---

## 🏥 Healthcare – Scan Like a Pro

AI helps doctors look at X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans.  
It can point out stuff like tumors or broken bones early on.  
That means faster help and fewer mistakes. 🩻💡

## 🛍️ Retail – Shelf Check, Real Quick

Stores use cameras to watch shelves.  
If something’s missing or in the wrong spot, AI notices and updates inventory instantly.  
No more empty shelves = happy shoppers! 🛒✨

---

## 🚗 Transportation – Self-Driving Smarts

Self-driving cars use computer vision to see road signs, lanes, people, and other cars.  
It helps them drive safely and make smart choices on the go. 🛣️🤖
