# 👀 What’s Computer Vision? Let’s Break It Down!

Computer vision is like giving super-eyes to machines! 🦾👁️  
It’s a part of AI (artificial intelligence) that helps tech understand what it sees—photos, videos, even live camera feeds. Cool, right?

It’s not just smart—it’s a time-saver and a game-changer. Let’s check out how it’s used in the real world:

---

## 🏭 Manufacturing – Spot the Oops!

Machines scan products zoom-zoom on the assembly line.  
They catch scratches, missing parts, or things out of place using smart image tools.  
Less waste, better quality. Boom! 💥

---

## 🏥 Healthcare – Scan Like a Pro

AI helps doctors look at X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans.  
It can point out stuff like tumors or broken bones early on.  
That means faster help and fewer mistakes. 🩻💡

---

## 🛍️ Retail – Shelf Check, Real Quick

Stores use cameras to watch shelves.  
If something’s missing or in the wrong spot, AI notices and updates inventory instantly.  
No more empty shelves = happy shoppers! 🛒✨

---

## 🚗 Transportation – Self-Driving Smarts

Self-driving cars use computer vision to see road signs, lanes, people, and other cars.  
It helps them drive safely and make smart choices on the go. 🛣️🤖

## 🔍 What’s Next?

Let’s dive into the core features of **Azure AI Vision Image Analysis** and see what it can really do! 💥

# 🧠✨ Azure AI Vision Image Analysis – Let’s Gooo!

## 📸 What’s the Deal?

Azure AI Vision is like giving your computer superhero eyes! 🦸‍♀️👀  
It can look at pics and instantly know what’s going on—no training wheels needed!

## 🔍 Built-In Powers (No Customization Needed!)

### 🗣️ Caption It!

![Skateboard](https://github.com/codess-aus/AI-Fundamentals-Prep/blob/e1267351acff7c9a81a198bd6631ad58759af4af/docs/assets/skateboard.png)

It looks at a pic and writes a caption like a pro.  
**Example:**  
🛹 *Image:* A person on a skateboard  
🧠 *Caption:* “A person jumping on a skateboard”  
Boom. Nailed it.

### 🧠 Object Spotting
It finds stuff in images and tells you how sure it is.  
**Example:**  
- Skateboard (🎯 90.40%)  
- Person (🎯 95.5%)  
It even gives you the exact spot with bounding boxes. 📦

### 🏷️ Tag It Up!
It slaps on smart tags so you can search and sort like a boss.  
**Example Tags for Skateboarder:**  
`sport`, `person`, `footwear`, `skating`, `kickflip`, `extreme sport`, `air`, `young`, `outdoor`  
(And like 20 more 🔥)

### 🔡 OCR = Text Detective
It reads text in images like a snack label at the store.  
**Example Output:**

## 🧪 Wanna Go Custom? You Can!

If the built-in stuff isn’t enough, train your own model! 🎓  
Azure AI Vision lets you build custom models using just a few images.

### 🍎 Image Classification
Teach it to tell apples from bananas from oranges.  
**Example:**  
- 🍏 Apple  ![Apple](https://github.com/codess-aus/AI-Fundamentals-Prep/blob/e1267351acff7c9a81a198bd6631ad58759af4af/docs/assets/apple.png)
- 🍌 Banana  ![Banana](https://github.com/codess-aus/AI-Fundamentals-Prep/blob/e1267351acff7c9a81a198bd6631ad58759af4af/docs/assets/banana.png)

### 🔍 Object Detection
Train it to find multiple things in one image.  
**Example:**  
- Detect all the fruits in a fruit bowl 🥝🍇🍓
